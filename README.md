# count
A terminal-based countdown program.

## Why? Initially I wrote
[countdown](https://github.com/msoulier/mikes-tools/blob/master/src/countdown.c),
a simple terminal based countdown program that I made sure used the system clock
in case I suspended my laptop, and had an --until argument which is something
that I really wanted.

Then I discovered the great work being done by
[Charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet) in Go, and I suddenly wanted to port
countdown to Go from C, so I started this.

## What can it do?
Well, I'll update this, 'cause right now it counts down or up and displays a
nice gradient progress bar, but I want it to have all of the functionality that
countdown.c currently has, and more. Stay tuned.
